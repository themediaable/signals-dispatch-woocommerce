== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What WhatsApp templates can I use? =

You can use any approved WhatsApp message templates from your WhatsApp Business Account. The plugin supports utility templates with dynamic variable substitution.

= How do I map order data to template variables? =

In Dispatch Rules, specify a JSON array of variable names that correspond to your template's placeholders:

`["billing_first_name", "order_number", "order_total"]`

Available variables include: order_id, order_number, order_total, order_currency, billing_first_name, billing_last_name, billing_phone, billing_email, shipping_first_name, shipping_last_name, status, site_name.

= Why aren't messages being sent? =

Check the following:
1. Verify your API credentials are correct in Signals → Setup
2. Ensure the customer has a valid phone number in their billing details
3. Check that dispatch rules are enabled for the order status
4. Verify that Action Scheduler is running (provided by WooCommerce)

= How do I receive delivery status updates? =

Configure your WhatsApp Business App to send webhooks to your site's endpoint. The plugin will automatically update message status as sent, delivered, read, or failed.

= Can customers opt out of WhatsApp messages? =

Yes, the plugin tracks customer opt-in/opt-out preferences and respects them when sending messages.
