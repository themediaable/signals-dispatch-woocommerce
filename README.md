Send WooCommerce order notifications via WhatsApp Business Cloud API using templated utility messages with automatic queueing, delivery logs, and webhook status updates.

## Description

Signals Dispatch for WooCommerce integrates your WooCommerce store with the WhatsApp Business Cloud API, enabling automated order notification messages to customers. The plugin supports:

- **Automated Order Notifications**: Send WhatsApp messages when order status changes (processing, completed, on-hold, cancelled)
- **Template-Based Messaging**: Use pre-approved WhatsApp message templates with dynamic order variables
- **Message Queue**: Reliable message delivery using WooCommerce Action Scheduler with automatic retry on failure
- **Delivery Tracking**: Real-time message status updates via webhooks (sent, delivered, read, failed)
- **Comprehensive Logs**: Full message history with payload and response details

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.0 or higher
- WooCommerce 7.0 or higher (provides Action Scheduler)
- PHP 7.4 or higher
- WhatsApp Business Account with Cloud API access
